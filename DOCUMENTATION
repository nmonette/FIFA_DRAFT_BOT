The bot uses 3 commands: 
1. !register
2. !clear
3. !start

Before beginning the draft, each participant must register for the draft by using the !register commmand in chat. 
This adds your USER ID to the list of participants (playerlist.json). 

To clear the list of participants, use  command !clear. 

To start the draft, command !start will assume the user intends to do an 11-man draft. If the user wishes to 
modify the number of players drafted, they can use the optional parameter to start a draft for x amount of 
players (for example, !start 10 would begin 10-man draft). 

Participants will be notified of the draft order (selected at random), and the bot will begin prompting
users when it is their turn to pick. 

Messages should be sent into the chat, saying the first and last name of the player (accents should not be used, 
and capitalization does not matter). If a player has been picked before, the bot will detect it, and ask the user 
to pick again. 

Upon completion, each participant's roster will be sent to them in a direct message. 

Happy Drafting!
