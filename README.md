# FIFA_DRAFT_BOT
Houses my project to create a discord bot in python, the function of which is to run a "draft" akin to the NFL or NBA draft, but. with FIFA players in the video game FIFA.

This project taught me how to use classes, was my introduction to working with an API (and thus the discord.py API), working with JSON objects, and asynchronous function structures.
